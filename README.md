# Javascript Code Test

### Notes

- I have done a couple of tests to demonstrate my knowledge however I don't know XML well enough to mock an XML response from the fetch request so have not added that into the test suite.
- Waterstones API doesn't work, I have only added it to show how you could add another seller with minimal overhead
- I didn't adhere to conventional commits and messages as this is a test and not production code

### Changes

- Original class refactored to a function
- Config file added for ease of adding new book vendors
- Converted to Typescript for type safety
- Unit tests added
- Dynamic query params builder added
